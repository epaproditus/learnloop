3. Image Block
   - [ ] Zoom controls could be smoother
   - [ ] Fullscreen mode needs ESC key support

4. Answer Block
   - [ ] LaTeX preview rendering needs improvement
   - [ ] Student answer state persistence

## Next Steps

1. Bug Fixes
   - Improve block positioning system
   - Enhance LaTeX rendering performance
   - Fix color picker state management
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for fullscreen

2. Potential Features
   - More LaTeX templates
   - Additional text formatting options
